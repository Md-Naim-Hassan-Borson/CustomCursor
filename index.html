    <p>A place is not exactly a “place” unless it means something or has some previous value to someone. A “place” could be where hunter-gatherers collected berries and fished, but it could also be where a girl named Mary had her first hike. As show in these examples, a place’s history can be something as grand as where the Romans fought the Greeks, or it can be a place that offered a small, yet memorable personal experience. Thus, the size of a place’s history can be different from person to person. Nonetheless, the significant thing is that a “place” holds some meaning and value to someone who has been there physically or psychologically</p>
    <p>In this essay, the author Analyzes lowry's quote from the giver, which is parallel to what a "place" is. the terms "sanctuary," "safety," and "comfort" vary between individuals of different values and beliefs.Opines that a "place" should hold some meaning and value to someone who has been there physically or psychologically.Opines that the term "place" has a deeper meaning than simply being an area in space. there is still much to explore about what makes 'a place' — until an undisputed agreement is reached, there shouldn't.</p>
    <p>Compare & Contrast of “Everybody's Ditch” and “In Praise of Hometowns”
    Analytical Essay In both of these excerpts place holds such significance to the authors. They mention that everyone has their own “haunted” place that may have shaped them into the person that they are today. In “Everybody's Ditch by Pyle” the author tells us the importance of a specific place –a ditch in the authors place. The ditch was a canal named “High Line Canal” in Denver. He mentions how it held and shaped him into the person he is in the present while also discussing about how other people have also enjoyed the presence of the such place. He is sad that its natural life is being cut due to the suburbs growing in Denver but the place still holds its special meaning in everyone's heart that has partaken with the ditch. Comparably, “In Praise of Hometowns by Pipher” also features a storyline of said place. The author discusses that any place can be made someone's ditch. The authors talks about how if one just absorbs the nature around them, they will in return love nature. It will become your home because you are one with it and not because the place is beautiful. The three topic that stand at the brink of such debate is the real meaning of “making a place your home”, “how different both the places are”, and “connecting with nature.”</p>

    <p>Analysis Of Ground Zero Analytical Essay
    That it is not a place of nothing, but is very much something. It is a place that helps one to remember. It is a place no longer filled with complete emptiness, but is beginning to repopulate with people coming to visit. This is so important because remembering helps to recall the absence of what once stood and happened, and people coming to remember together helps to fill that</p>

    <p>Deborah Tall's From Where We Stand Analytical Essay
    Virtually all of these writers share a common feeling that mainstream American society has lost its roots. With our extreme mobility we have lost connectedness with the land. We tend to avoid what is unique and defining of landscapes and to look for what is common or universal. When we drive through small communities, we stop to eat at the Burger King or McDonalds instead of investigating Aunt Sue's Loggers' Cafe. In a way, we have invented "everyplace" by universalizing the common things that we expect and seem to need --- familiar motel facades, common fast food menus, universal cable TV access, etc. But what these authors question is whether "everyplace" is really a "place" at all, hence, whether it serves the needs of being grounded in a place, knowing a landscape, feeling the history of habitation, belonging.</p>
